# Restaurant Reviews
Udacity project for the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree Program.

## Project overview and notes
The project is currently in **Stage 1**, which means that it fully responsive, hopefully, accessible and has a decent offline experience.

Other than trying to meet the Requirements for this stage, I also tried to improve the UI, and use the latest CSS and JS tech when possible, but there are still some improvements needed in that area.

Also, its important to note, that I would like to use a package bundler like Webpack(parcel, or brunch etc) but since it wasn't required and I didn't have much free time anyway, I didn't do it.
