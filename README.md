# Restaurant Reviews
Udacity project for the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree Program.
This project is also hosted at: https://restaurant-reviews-26769.firebaseapp.com/

**Note:** The stage 2 Development Server needs to be running on the machine at port 1337 in order for this to work.

## Project overview and notes
The project is currently in **Stage 2**, which means that it fully responsive, hopefully, accessible and has a good offline experience, in addition it currently has a consistent score of 78/100/93 on the lighthouse audits: Performance/WPA/A11y

Other than trying to meet the Requirements for this stage, I also tried to improve the UI, and use the latest CSS and JS tech when possible, but there are still some improvements needed in that area.

I intentionally didn't use any pollyfills for new features, i intended it to be used on new browsers.
